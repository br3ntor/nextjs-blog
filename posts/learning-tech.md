Once upon a time in a city so fine,
Lived a man named br3ntor, his brain was like swine.
He wanted to learn Typescript, Next.js, and Tailwind,
All at once, his mind was in a tight bind.

He read and he scrolled, but nothing made sense,
His code was a mess, it lacked all coherence.
He took breaks in between, walked his dog with a frown,
Until one day, he found something on the ground.

It was a dirty sock, with holes and some lint,
But br3ntor picked it up with the biggest of grins.
He studied and tinkered, with sock in his hand,
And soon he found, he began to understand.

He coded with ease, his skills began to grow,
All thanks to that sock, who knew it would bestow?
But br3ntor didn't stop there, he wanted to learn more,
So he walked his dog again, this time near the store.

And there on the ground, he found a used straw,
He picked it up and studied, it was his new law.
He coded and typed, with straw in his teeth,
And soon he found, he became a coding beef.

But little did br3ntor know, that his path was so bleak,
For he was becoming like Ignatius Reilly, so to speak.
He rambled and ranted, like a man gone mad,
All thanks to Typescript, Next.js, and Tailwind, what a fad.

And so dear reader, let this be a lesson,
Don't try to learn all at once, it will lead to regression.
And if you must, don't follow in br3ntor's path,
Lest you become like him, a dark comedic aftermath.
